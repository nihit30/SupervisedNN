/**********************  SUPERVISED NEURAL NETWORKS ************************/

Dataset used for testing : Iris


# Application specific hash-defines and variables :  

1) MAX_LAYERS -> Signifies total layers of the network

2) NUMBER_OF_OUTPUTS -> Total number of output neurons

3) NUMBER_OF_FEATURES -> Corresponds to total number of columns in dataset

4) inputAddress -> Maps input to the network from txt file

   outputAddress -> Maps output of the network from txt file
   
5) Two activation units are provided currently,

   sigmoid (sigmoidDerivative, used for backprop)
   
   tanH    (tanHDerivative, used for backprop)
